# Image Restoration Web App

an Image Restoration Web App capable of denoising, deblurring Using NAFNet Model but we edited Simplified Channel Attention Module to be Multi-head Transposed Attention, and inpainting old images Using Microsoft's deep latent space translation pretrained model. 

## Features

-   **Denoising:** Removes noise from images.
-   **Deblurring:** Enhances blurred images, restoring sharpness and clarity.   
- **Inpainting:** Fills in missing or damaged areas of images seamlessly.

## Usage
